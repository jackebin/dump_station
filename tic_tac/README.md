    old stuff joining the dump.

    this tic_tac_toe game was actually my first project in C, originally posted in February 2021 in its own (!) repository.
    I'm refurnishing the hub at the moment before upcoming studies and felt the time had come to let this bad boy live with
    the rest of my experimental stuff.
