    Old stuff joining the dump.
  
    this tic_tac_toe game was actually my first project in C, originally posted in February 2021 in it's own (!) repository. I'm refurnishing
    the hub at the moment before upcoming studies and felt the time had come to let this bad boy live with the rest of my experimental
    stuff. this code makes me smile and I know it's going to be true about recently added stuff (while writing this) as well in time
    and that's what "the dump" is all about =)
