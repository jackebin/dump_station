I'm experimenting around for the first time with libraries, Make and unit testing and built some kind of quiz application in the process. 
Current build is static linked. I've made it work dynamically as well but for some reason this build always turns out unstable and behaves 
quite unpredictable but Iâ€™m going to add a second binary and unit test when I've solved it*.

*Solved.

Current quizzes:

	1	Data Types
	2	Type Sizes
	1	Type Modes
